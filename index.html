  <h2 id="Hassett-Bump">U.S. Stock Market Sees Wild Swings as Tariff Pause Rumors and Denials Collide</h2>
  <div class="meta">

  <p>This morning, at around 07:23 MST on April 7, 2025, U.S. stock indexes experienced a dramatic reversal, briefly surging after reports emerged on X suggesting that White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett had indicated President Donald Trump was considering a 90-day pause in tariffs for all countries except China. The news sparked optimism among investors, leading to a temporary rally as markets interpreted the potential pause as a de-escalation in the ongoing trade war that has rattled global finances. Posts on X captured the sentiment, with users noting the market's swift reaction to the possibility of relief from Trump's sweeping tariff policies, which had already driven the S&P 500 into bear market territory, down 20% from its recent high.</p>

<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gn8OBlRXcAA1Iud?format=jpg&name=large" style="text-align: center;"></p>

    <p>However, the relief was short-lived. Just hours later, the White House issued a denial, clarifying that no such 90-day pause was under consideration. This retraction, also reflected in posts on X, caused markets to reverse course once again, plunging back into negative territory. The denial from the White House, attributed to official statements contradicting Hassett’s alleged comments, underscored the uncertainty and volatility surrounding Trump’s tariff strategy. Investors, already on edge due to the president’s aggressive trade policies and their global repercussions, reacted with frustration and skepticism, as evidenced by discussions trending on X.</p>

    <p>The rollercoaster day highlights the fragile state of investor confidence, with markets hanging on every word from White House officials and reacting instantaneously to shifting narratives. Earlier reports, such as those from CNBC and The New York Times, had already detailed the market turmoil triggered by Trump’s tariffs, with the S&P 500 suffering its worst day since the pandemic on April 3, 2025, after the initial tariff announcements. Today’s events only amplified those fears, as the brief hope of a tariff pause was quickly dashed, leaving Wall Street to grapple with the reality of continued trade tensions.</p>

    <p>Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, has been a central figure in these developments. While he has previously defended Trump’s tariffs as a means to benefit American workers, today’s conflicting reports—whether miscommunication or strategic leaks—have added to the confusion. Some X users speculated that the initial report might have been a market manipulation tactic, while others criticized the White House for its lack of clear communication. Regardless, the episode serves as a stark reminder of the high stakes involved, with global markets teetering on the brink of further decline if trade wars intensify.</p>

    <p>As of the latest updates, major indexes like the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 were sharply lower, with fears of a recession growing. The White House’s refusal to back down, as reiterated by officials like Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who insisted the tariffs would remain “in place for days and weeks,” has done little to calm nerves. Trending discussions on X suggest that investors are now bracing for potential Federal Reserve intervention, possibly through interest rate cuts, to mitigate the economic fallout. For now, the U.S. stock market remains a barometer of uncertainty, with today’s reversal serving as a microcosm of the broader challenges facing global trade under Trump’s policies.</p>

  <h2 id="House-Divided">Republican Lawmakers Divided: A Tidal Wave of Reactions to Trump’s 2025 Tariff Bombshell</h2>
  <div class="meta">
    <span class="date">Date: 2025-04-06</span>
    <span class="byline">By: Pirate News</span>

  </div>
  <p>In a move that sent shockwaves through global markets and political corridors alike, President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariff announcement on April 2, 2025—dubbed “Liberation Day”—has unleashed a storm of reactions among Republican lawmakers at both federal and state levels. The announcement, which imposed a baseline 10% tariff on virtually all imports and higher “reciprocal” tariffs on dozens of countries, has exposed deep fissures within the GOP, with some hailing it as a bold stroke for American jobs and others warning of economic peril and political fallout.</p>

    <p>At the federal level, the Senate became an early battleground. On April 2, a rare bipartisan rebuke emerged when four prominent Republican senators—Susan Collins of Maine, Rand Paul and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska—joined all 47 Democrats to pass a 51-48 resolution aiming to block Trump’s tariffs on Canadian imports. This move, led by Democrat Tim Kaine, signaled significant unease, with McConnell calling tariffs “bad policy” that would hurt working Americans by driving up costs. Rand Paul went further, arguing the tariffs were unconstitutional, asserting that Congress, not the president, should hold the power to impose such taxes. Yet, this Senate action was largely symbolic, as House Speaker Mike Johnson, a staunch Trump ally, showed no interest in letting it advance, highlighting the GOP’s tightrope walk between loyalty and pragmatism.</p>

    <p>Other federal Republicans displayed a spectrum of responses. Senate Majority Leader John Thune and Whip John Barrasso defended the tariffs, framing them as necessary to end decades of unfair trade practices and bring manufacturing back to the U.S. However, critics like Chuck Grassley of Iowa, a senior Republican, introduced bipartisan legislation with Democrat Maria Cantwell to rein in Trump’s tariff authority, proposing that Congress must approve new tariffs within 60 days or see them expire. Grassley’s move, rooted in concerns for Iowa’s agricultural exports, underscored a growing fear that Trump’s gambit could ignite a global trade war, raising prices for consumers and risking retaliation from allies and adversaries alike. Posts on X captured this tension, with some lawmakers like Ted Cruz and Rand Paul publicly questioning the tariffs’ impact, labeling them a “tax on the American people.”</p>

    <p>In the House, the response was similarly split. Speaker Johnson downplayed market turmoil, insisting on Fox Business that the initial disruption was expected and that Trump’s boldness was long overdue. Yet, private anxieties among House Republicans, as reported by The Washington Post, revealed fears that permanent tariffs could devastate local economies and jeopardize their slim 2026 midterm majorities. Only one House Democrat, Jared Golden of Maine, supported the 10% tariff, but GOP unity was far from assured, with some members quietly bracing for voter backlash if prices spike and jobs vanish.</p>

    <p>State-level Republicans, particularly in trade-dependent regions, added another layer of complexity. Governors like Kim Reynolds of Iowa, while publicly supportive, admitted to working directly with the administration to mitigate short-term damage to agriculture—a sector already reeling from Trump’s earlier tariff threats. In states like North Carolina and Wisconsin, senators like Thom Tillis and Ron Johnson expressed caution, with Tillis warning of “irreparable damage” to farmers and Johnson calling the strategy a “high-risk bet.” These reactions suggest that state GOP leaders, closer to the ground, are feeling the immediate pressure of Trump’s policies on constituents who rely on cross-border trade and affordable goods.</p>

    <p>The market’s reaction—Wall Street’s worst day since the pandemic, with the S&P 500 plummeting nearly 5%—only intensified the debate. Trump dismissed the sell-off, claiming on April 3 that “the markets are going to boom,” but economists and even some GOP lawmakers weren’t convinced. A Reuters/Ipsos poll cited in multiple reports found that 53% of Americans, including a significant chunk of Republicans, believe tariffs will do more harm than good, fueling fears of inflation and recession. This public sentiment, echoed in trending discussions on X, has some Republicans questioning whether Trump’s “America First” protectionism might sink their party’s electoral prospects in 2026.</p>

    <p>Critics within the party, like former Vice President Mike Pence, labeled the tariffs “the largest peacetime tax hike in U.S. history,” estimating a $3,500 annual hit to families. Meanwhile, Trump loyalists like Rick Scott of Florida doubled down, arguing the focus should be on jobs, not stock prices. This ideological clash paints a picture of a GOP torn between its traditional free-trade roots and Trump’s populist vision, with the tariff announcement acting as a litmus test of loyalty versus principle.</p>

    <p>As of April 5, the political seas are choppy. Democrats are seizing the moment, with figures like Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries warning of a “financial forest fire” and planning legislative end-runs to force votes on reversing the tariffs. Republicans, however, are caught in a bind: defy Trump and risk his wrath, or back him and gamble on an economic strategy that could backfire spectacularly. Whether this tariff tempest will strengthen Trump’s grip on the party or spark a rebellion remains to be seen, but one thing is clear—the GOP’s pirate ship is navigating treacherous waters in 2025.</p>

    <h2 id="Art-of-the-Deal">Global Response to Trump’s Tariffs: Which Countries Are Negotiating New Trade Deals, and Will the Strategy Succeed?</h2>
    <div class="meta">

    </div>
    <p>As of early April 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump’s imposition of sweeping tariffs has triggered a global wave of reactions, with several countries reaching out to negotiate new trade deals or push for zero tariff agreements to mitigate the economic impact of his policies. Trump’s strategy, announced on April 2, 2025, includes a 10% baseline tariff on all imports and higher individualized tariffs ranging from 11% to 50% on 57 countries, based on perceived trade imbalances and non-reciprocal trade practices. This article explores which countries are engaging with the U.S., the nature of their responses, and whether Trump’s tariff gambit is likely to achieve its intended goals of reducing trade deficits, boosting domestic manufacturing, and enhancing national security.</p>

<p><strong>Countries Actively Negotiating or Proposing Zero Tariff Deals</strong></p>

<p>Several nations have signaled their willingness to negotiate with the Trump administration to avoid or reduce the impact of these tariffs. Based on reports from web sources and posts on X, the following countries stand out:</p>

<p><strong>1. Vietnam, South Korea, Thailand, and Japan:</strong> These Asian countries have been particularly proactive. Posts on X and articles from Reuters and CNBC indicate that Vietnam, South Korea, Thailand, and Japan have initiated negotiations with the White House to discuss trade and tariffs. For instance, Vietnam and South Korea are exploring zero tariff agreements, with Vietnam’s Minister of Industry and Trade sending a diplomatic note requesting a delay in tariff imposition to allow for further discussions. Japan’s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba described the tariffs as a “national crisis,” prompting urgent talks to minimize their impact. Thailand, while less detailed in reports, is also said to be engaging, likely due to its significant export reliance on the U.S. market.</p>

<p><strong>2. India:</strong> India has emerged as a key player, with reports from the Financial Times and posts on X suggesting it is willing to reduce tariffs on 55% of U.S. imports (worth $23 billion) down to zero or very low rates, currently ranging from 5-30%. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s recent visit to the White House and ongoing negotiations aim to double bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030, indicating a strategic shift to align with U.S. demands and avoid retaliatory measures. India’s approach appears calculated, balancing its desire to attract U.S. manufacturing with protecting its domestic industries.</p>

<p><strong>3. Canada and Mexico:</strong> Although already hit with a 25% tariff on many goods in early March 2025, both countries are deeply engaged in dialogue. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum have indicated a preference for negotiation over retaliation, with Canada imposing counter-tariffs but also sending trade delegations to Washington. Mexico, despite initially vowing countermeasures, has opted for a non-confrontational stance, focusing on compliance with the USMCA and border security to potentially negotiate exemptions. Their close economic ties with the U.S. make them particularly vulnerable, pushing them to seek relief.</p>

<p><strong>4. European Union (EU) Countries:</strong> The EU, facing a 20% tariff, has threatened retaliation but also signaled openness to talks. French President Emmanuel Macron and other EU leaders have urged a pause on investments in the U.S. while preparing countermeasures, but there’s also a push for negotiation. Posts on X and articles from the Atlantic Council suggest some EU nations, like the UK, are considering reducing digital service taxes to appease Trump, while others, like Spain and Poland, are exploring bilateral deals to protect their exports.</p>

<p><strong>5. Argentina, Israel, and Others:</strong> Smaller players like Argentina and Israel have also expressed interest in zero tariff deals. Posts on X claim that both countries have “hopped on the bandwagon” of cutting tariffs, with Argentina and Israel reportedly in discussions to align their trade policies with U.S. demands. Taiwan has publicly pledged more investment and zero tariffs, according to Reuters, while Brazil and Australia, though initially critical, are also assessing negotiation options to avoid escalation.</p>

<p><strong>Assessing Trump’s Tariff Gambit: Will It Work?</strong></p>

<p>Trump’s tariff strategy hinges on the assumption that economic pressure will force trading partners to concede, reduce their own tariffs, and shift manufacturing back to the U.S. However, several factors suggest the outcome is far from certain.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Success Factors:</strong></p>

<p>- <strong>Leverage Through Pain:</strong> The tariffs have already caused market turmoil, with global stock indices dropping sharply and countries like Japan and Canada reporting economic contraction fears. This pain could pressure nations to negotiate, as seen with Vietnam, India, and the EU exploring concessions. If Trump can maintain a hardline stance, he might extract short-term trade deals, such as zero tariff agreements or increased market access for U.S. goods.</p>

<p>- <strong>Manufacturing Incentive:</strong> The White House argues that higher import costs will incentivize companies to relocate production to the U.S., creating jobs and reducing reliance on foreign supply chains. Early signs, like the U.S. auto industry’s support for tariffs, suggest some sectors may benefit, but the timeline for such shifts is unclear.</p>

<p><strong>Challenges and Risks:</strong></p>

<p>- <strong>Retaliation and Trade Wars:</strong> Many countries, including China, Canada, and the EU, have already imposed or threatened retaliatory tariffs, which could escalate into a full-blown trade war. China’s 34% tariff on U.S. goods and the EU’s planned countermeasures could offset any gains for the U.S., hurting exporters like farmers and manufacturers. This tit-for-tat dynamic could negate Trump’s leverage, as seen in his first term when China retaliated against U.S. agricultural exports.</p>

<p>- <strong>Economic Costs for the U.S.:</strong> Analysts, including those at the Tax Foundation and Capital Economics, warn that Trump’s tariffs could raise prices for American consumers, potentially increasing inflation to 5% and reducing U.S. GDP by 1.5-2%. The cost of goods like iPhones, cars, and energy could skyrocket, undermining Trump’s promise to boost the economy. If public backlash grows, political pressure could force a rollback.</p>

<p>- <strong>Global Supply Chain Disruption:</strong> The tariffs risk disrupting integrated supply chains, particularly in North America and Asia. Canada, Mexico, and the U.S. rely heavily on each other for parts and materials, and higher costs could drive companies to source from other regions, like China or Southeast Asia, rather than the U.S. This could deepen U.S. dependence on adversarial nations, contradicting Trump’s national security goals.</p>

<p>- <strong>Limited Negotiating Flexibility:</strong> Trump’s “not a negotiation” rhetoric, as stated by aides like Peter Navarro, may alienate potential partners. While some countries are willing to talk, others, like China and the EU, may view the tariffs as non-negotiable aggression, leading to prolonged conflict rather than cooperation. The lack of clarity on exemptions and the broad scope of the tariffs (affecting even tiny territories like Heard and McDonald Islands) have fueled global uncertainty, making trust-building difficult.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>

<p>Trump’s tariff imposition has undeniably forced many countries to the negotiating table, with Vietnam, India, Japan, South Korea, and others proposing zero tariff deals or significant concessions. This suggests his strategy has initial leverage, particularly against smaller or more trade-dependent nations. However, the gambit’s success depends on whether he can sustain pressure without triggering a destructive trade war, manage domestic economic fallout, and achieve lasting structural changes in global trade.</p>

<p>Current evidence indicates mixed results. While some countries are adjusting their policies, the risk of retaliation, higher consumer prices, and supply chain disruptions could undermine Trump’s goals. Historical precedent from his first term shows that tariffs often lead to short-term gains but long-term economic strain, as seen with the U.S.-China trade war. Unless Trump can pivot from confrontation to strategic diplomacy, his tariff hike may prove more costly than beneficial, both for the U.S. and the global economy.</p>

    <h2 id="Tariffs-China">Tariff Tensions and Strategic Shifts: How U.S. Trade Pressure Is Reshaping China’s Economy and Political Posture</h2>
    <div class="meta">
      <span class="date">Date: 2025-04-06</span>

    </div>
  <p>The recent escalation in trade tensions between the United States and China has introduced significant challenges to China's economy and political landscape. The U.S. administration's decision to impose a 34% tariff on Chinese imports has raised the average duty on Chinese goods to approximately 70%, exerting considerable pressure on China's export-driven economy. In retaliation, China has implemented reciprocal tariffs and restricted rare-earth exports, intensifying the trade conflict. These developments have profound implications for China's economic growth, industrial strategies, and political dynamics.</p>

  <strong>Economic Impact</strong>

  <p>The heightened tariffs are poised to significantly affect China's economic performance. Economists predict that these measures could reduce China's GDP growth by 1 to 2 percentage points this year. In response, Beijing is intensifying efforts to stimulate domestic consumption to offset the decline in exports and maintain its targeted 5% GDP growth for 2025.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the tariffs have accelerated China's efforts to diversify its trade partnerships. Facing increased barriers in the U.S. market, Chinese exporters are seeking alternative markets in regions such as the Middle East, Southeast Asia, Africa, South America, and Russia. Some companies are also relocating production to countries like Vietnam, Mexico, and Indonesia to circumvent U.S. tariffs. This shift reflects a strategic move to reduce reliance on the U.S. market and mitigate the impact of ongoing trade tensions.</p>

  <strong>Industrial and Supply Chain Adjustments</strong>

  <p>The trade war has prompted significant adjustments within China's industrial sector. Manufacturers are exploring new supply chains and production bases to adapt to the changing trade environment. This realignment aims to maintain competitiveness and access to key markets amid escalating tariffs. Additionally, China's restrictions on rare-earth exports serve as a strategic countermeasure, leveraging its dominance in this critical sector to exert pressure on the U.S. and highlight the interconnectedness of global supply chains.</p>

  <strong>Political Implications</strong>

  <p>Domestically, the trade conflict has fueled nationalist sentiments, with the Chinese government portraying the U.S. tariffs as an unjustified attack on China's economic sovereignty. This narrative has been used to bolster public support for the government's retaliatory measures and economic policies. The external pressure has allowed Chinese leadership to attribute economic challenges to foreign actions, thereby reinforcing national unity and resilience.</p>

  <p>Internationally, China's retaliatory actions and efforts to form new trade alliances signal a strategic pivot in its foreign policy. By seeking closer economic ties with other nations, China aims to counterbalance U.S. influence and reduce its vulnerability to unilateral trade measures. However, these efforts face challenges, as potential partners may be cautious due to existing geopolitical tensions and trade imbalances.</p>

  <strong>Final Thoughts</strong>

  <p>The recent tariff escalations between the U.S. and China have introduced significant economic and political challenges for China. While the immediate economic impact includes potential reductions in GDP growth and disruptions to the export sector, China's strategic responses—such as stimulating domestic consumption, diversifying trade partnerships, and leveraging its position in critical industries—reflect a comprehensive approach to mitigating these challenges. Politically, the trade conflict has reinforced nationalist sentiments and prompted a recalibration of China's international economic engagements. The evolving dynamics of this trade war will continue to shape China's economic strategies and political landscape in the foreseeable future.</p>

    <h2 id="Tariff-Opinion">Trump's Tariffs: A Populist Promise Fulfilled</h2>
    <div class="meta">
      <span class="date">Date: 2025-04-05</span>
      <span class="byline">By: Pirate News</span>
      <span class="directlink"><a href="#Tariff-Opinion">Direct Link</a></span>
    </div>
<p>President Donald Trump's recent tariff announcements are not a sudden shift in policy, but rather a direct fulfillment of the populist promises that propelled him back into the White House. Throughout his 2024 campaign, Trump consistently hammered home the message of "America First," vowing to protect American industries and workers from what he deemed unfair foreign competition. His tariff policies are the embodiment of this pledge.</p>

<p>Here's why this aligns with his populist campaign:</p>

<strong>Economic Nationalism:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Trump's tariffs resonate with a segment of the population that feels left behind by globalization. These individuals believe that free trade agreements have led to job losses and the decline of American manufacturing. Trump's tariffs offer a sense of economic nationalism, prioritizing domestic production over international trade.</li>
            <li>By placing tariffs on imported goods, Trump aims to incentivize companies to bring manufacturing back to the United States. This message of "bringing jobs home" was a cornerstone of his campaign, and the tariffs are a tangible action that aligns with this rhetoric.</li>
        </ul>
    
    <strong>Challenging the Status Quo:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Trump's populist appeal stems from his willingness to challenge established norms and institutions. His tariffs disrupt the traditional free-trade consensus, positioning him as a disruptor who is willing to take bold action to protect American interests.</li>
            <li>This "outsider" image, cultivated during his campaign, is reinforced by his tariff policies. They are seen as a direct challenge to the global economic order, appealing to voters who feel that the system is rigged against them.</li>
        </ul>
    
    <strong>Targeting Specific Groups:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Trump's campaign focused on appealing to working-class voters, particularly in the manufacturing sector. His tariffs are designed to protect these industries, delivering on his promise to prioritize their interests.</li>
            <li>By framing trade as a zero-sum game, where foreign countries are "taking advantage" of the United States, Trump taps into a sense of grievance among these voters. The tariffs are presented as a way to level the playing field and restore fairness to the American worker.</li>
        </ul>
    <strong>Trade Deficits and "Unfair" Trade:</strong>

            <li>Trump's rhetoric during the 2024 campaign constantly focused on trade deficits, and his view that other countries were taking advantage of the United States. The tariffs are a direct action to counter act what he deems as unfair trade practices.</li>

    <p>On April 2, 2025, President Donald Trump declared what he termed "Liberation Day," announcing a sweeping set of tariffs aimed at a broad range of imported goods. This move has sparked intense debate, drawing comparisons to historical trade policies and raising questions about its potential impact on the U.S. and global economies.</p>

<p><strong>The Announcement</strong></p>

<p>President Trump's new tariff regime imposes a baseline 10% tariff on nearly all foreign imports, with significantly higher rates for specific countries: 54% on Chinese goods, 49% on products from Cambodia, 46% on Vietnamese imports, and 20% on goods from the European Union. The administration asserts that these measures are designed to rectify longstanding trade imbalances and protect American industries from unfair foreign competition. The White House stated that these tariffs are intended to "strengthen the international economic position of the United States and protect American workers."</p>

<p><strong>Historical Context</strong></p>

<p>The United States has a long and complex history with protectionist trade policies. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, high tariffs were implemented to shield burgeoning American industries. However, one of the most infamous examples is the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, which raised U.S. tariffs to historically high levels. This act is widely believed to have exacerbated the Great Depression by triggering retaliatory tariffs from other nations, leading to a significant decline in international trade.</p>

<p>In the post-World War II era, the U.S. shifted towards promoting free trade, leading to the establishment of institutions like the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and later the World Trade Organization (WTO). This shift was based on the understanding that reduced trade barriers foster global economic growth and stability.</p>

<p><strong>Potential Implications</strong></p>

<p>The newly announced tariffs have already begun to send shockwaves through financial markets. Major U.S. stock indices experienced significant declines in the days following the announcement, with the Nasdaq and Russell 2000 entering bear market territory. The Dow Jones and S&P 500 also saw substantial losses, marking one of the worst weeks since the 2020 COVID-19 crash.</p>

<p>Economists warn that these tariffs could lead to a reduction in U.S. economic growth by up to 2 percentage points, potentially raising unemployment rates to 7.5%. Inflationary pressures are also a concern, as the increased cost of imports may be passed on to consumers, leading to an estimated additional annual expense of $3,800 per household.</p>

<p>Internationally, affected countries are contemplating retaliatory measures. China, for instance, has already imposed a 34% levy on all U.S. imports in response. Such actions could escalate into a full-blown trade war, further disrupting global supply chains and economic stability.</p>

<p><strong>Political Reactions</strong></p>

<p>The tariffs have elicited strong reactions from both sides of the political aisle. Some Republicans fear the economic repercussions could jeopardize their standing in the upcoming midterm elections. Senator Mitch McConnell expressed concern over the potential for these tariffs to "derail the economic progress we've made." Democrats have also voiced opposition, with Senator Chuck Schumer stating that the tariffs are "reckless and risk plunging us into a needless recession."</p>

<p><strong>Looking Ahead</strong></p>

<p>The trajectory of this new trade policy remains uncertain. While the administration aims to leverage tariffs to negotiate more favorable trade terms, the risk of escalating retaliatory measures and prolonged economic disruption looms large. Historically, such protectionist measures have led to unintended negative consequences, suggesting caution is warranted.</p>

<p>President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs represent a significant shift in U.S. trade policy, harkening back to earlier eras of protectionism. The coming months will be critical in determining whether these measures will achieve their intended goals or lead to broader economic challenges both domestically and internationally.</p>
